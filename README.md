-Try subtracting conveyor velocity instead of setting to 0. Also, some blocks get stuck inside the conveyor when tossed through it.

-Bouncy block doesn't push the player very far when he collides horizontally with it. Maybe check if it's sideways and add additional force? Or use something other than velocity to bounce? Such as force?

-Add other forms of movement to moving platforms, and maybe a pause option

-general cleanup needs done

-Get get on stuck walls when holding some items.

-Heavy items can land on head and be hard to get off. Try making character head collider round?

-It might be better to use a fixed joint for climbing. That way you can use a break force to knock off the ladder.

-Maybe throw aim with the mouse?

-Stuff to add: drop platforms, dissappearing platforms, enemies, water, inventory system, items with actions
