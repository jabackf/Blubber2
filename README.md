-Sometimes the player can land on the bottom side of a platform collision box for platforms with an effector

-Bouncy block doesn't push the player very far when he collides horizontally with it. Maybe check if it's sideways and add additional force?

-Add other forms of movement to moving platforms, and maybe a pause option

-When pushing against wall:
NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object
CharacterController2D.Move (System.Single move, System.Boolean crouch, System.Boolean jump)
